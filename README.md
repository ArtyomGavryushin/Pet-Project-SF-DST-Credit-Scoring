# Pet-Project-SF-DST-Credit-Scoring

The goal of this project is to develop an effective scoring model for secondary bank customers in order to predict the probability of default. To achieve this goal, we will analyze a variety of variables that characterize the profile of borrowers.

The data to be analyzed is a set provided on the Kaggle platform called "[SF-DST] Credit Scoring". This set includes a variety of attributes that describe borrowers, such as education level, gender, age, car availability, number of denied past applications, and many others. Each of these attributes can be important in building an accurate model capable of predicting the probability of default.

We will focus on examining these variables and other aspects of the data to identify and determine the significant factors that influence a customer's probability of default. An effective scoring model built on these analyses will allow the bank to more accurately assess risk in making loans and make more informed decisions.

The next stages of our analysis will include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and model evaluation.
